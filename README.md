# Save Food Project (3RQ3)

##### Description
This project is a Python test suite to test some 
basic functional requirements of Save Food Application. 
When creating test for user 'authentication', I have added data.json to mock Save Food database and 
a separate `__db__.py` to handle it. If there is any issue running the test suite, please contact [here](mailto:raic1@mcmaster.ca).


>SAVE FOOD is a platform that helps connect people who want to donate food and those who 
>want to consume food. Food donor can share, and food consumer can acquire reusable food which 
>otherwise could be wasted. The system aims to reduce hunger and increase social wealth by preventing 
>the wastage of food and saving resources.
